## Introduction

The Eden DevOps Suite is designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines the security measures implemented in the system and provides guidelines for maintaining a secure environment.

## Secrets Management

Eden uses HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for secure secrets management.

### HashiCorp Vault Integration

The Eden Vault Service integrates with HashiCorp Vault to provide:

- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Dynamic secrets generation
- Secret rotation
- Access control policies
- Audit logging

Configuration:

```yaml
# Environment variables for HashiCorp Vault integration
SECRETS_MANAGER_TYPE=HASHICORP_VAULT
VAULT_URL=https://vault.example.com:8200
VAULT_TOKEN=vault-token
VAULT_NAMESPACE=eden
```

### AWS Secrets Manager Integration

Alternatively, Eden can use AWS Secrets Manager for:

- Centralized secrets management
- Automatic rotation
- Fine-grained access control
- Encryption at rest and in transit

Configuration:

```yaml
# Environment variables for AWS Secrets Manager integration
SECRETS_MANAGER_TYPE=AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=aws-secret-key
AWS_SECRETS_PREFIX=eden/
```

### Best Practices

1. Never store secrets in code or configuration files
2. Rotate secrets regularly
3. Use least privilege access for secret retrieval
4. Enable audit logging for all secret access
5. Implement secret versioning for recovery

## Container Security

Eden implements container security scanning using Trivy to detect vulnerabilities in container images.

### Scanning Process

1. Images are scanned during the CI/CD pipeline
2. Vulnerabilities are categorized by severity
3. Critical vulnerabilities block deployment
4. Reports are generated for review

### Best Practices

1. Use minimal base images
2. Keep base images updated
3. Scan images regularly
4. Use non-root users in containers
5. Implement read-only file systems where possible
6. Use container runtime security tools

## Network Security

Eden implements network security policies to control traffic between services.

### Kubernetes Network Policies

Network policies are defined for each service to:

- Restrict ingress/egress traffic
- Allow only necessary communication paths
- Isolate services from each other
- Protect sensitive services

Example policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: vault-service-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: vault-service
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api-gateway
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: postgres
```

### Best Practices

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Implement network segmentation
3. Use explicit ingress and egress rules
4. Regularly audit network policies
5. Monitor network traffic for anomalies

## Dependency Management

Eden uses OWASP dependency scanning to detect vulnerable dependencies.

### Scanning Process

1. Dependencies are scanned during the build process
2. Vulnerabilities are categorized by severity
3. Critical vulnerabilities block the build
4. Reports are generated for review

### Best Practices

1. Keep dependencies updated
2. Remove unused dependencies
3. Use dependency locking
4. Monitor for security advisories
5. Implement a vulnerability management process

## Role-Based Access Control

Eden implements a comprehensive RBAC system to control access to resources.

### RBAC Components

1. **Users**: Authenticated individuals
2. **Roles**: Collections of permissions
3. **Permissions**: Granular access controls
4. **Resources**: Protected entities

### Permission Structure

Permissions follow the format: `action:resource[:resourceId]`

Examples:
- `read:secret`
- `write:workflow`
- `execute:task:123`

### Built-in Roles

- **Owner**: Full system access
- **Admin**: Administrative access
- **Developer**: Development access
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Best Practices

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Regularly audit role assignments
3. Implement role rotation for sensitive positions
4. Use resource-specific permissions
5. Log all permission checks

## API Security

Eden implements various API security measures to protect endpoints.

### Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### CORS Configuration

CORS is configured to:

- Allow only specific origins
- Control allowed methods
- Restrict allowed headers
- Manage credentials

### Best Practices

1. Validate all input
2. Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
3. Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. Rate limit API requests
5. Monitor for suspicious activity

## Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

Eden implements rate limiting to protect against abuse and DDoS attacks.

### Rate Limiting Strategy

- Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Path-specific rate limits
- IP-based rate limiting
- Whitelisting and blacklisting

### DDoS Protection

- Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs
- Gradual request throttling
- Request validation
- Resource usage monitoring

### Best Practices

1. Set appropriate rate limits
2. Implement graceful degradation
3. Use CDN for static content
4. Monitor traffic patterns
5. Have an incident response plan

## Security Logging and Monitoring

Eden implements comprehensive security logging and monitoring.

### Security Events

The following security events are logged:

- Authentication events
- Access control events
- Data access events
- Security configuration events
- Threat events

### Monitoring

- Real-time security metrics
- Alerting for suspicious activity
- Anomaly detection
- Audit trail for compliance

### Best Practices

1. Centralize logs
2. Implement log retention policies
3. Protect log integrity
4. Set up alerts for security events
5. Regularly review logs

## Secure Communication

Eden implements mTLS for secure service-to-service communication.

### mTLS Implementation

- Mutual TLS authentication
- Certificate-based service identity
- Encrypted communication
- Certificate rotation

### Best Practices

1. Use strong TLS configurations
2. Implement certificate rotation
3. Validate certificate chains
4. Monitor for certificate expiration
5. Use secure cipher suites

## Security Incident Response

### Incident Response Process

1. **Detection**: Identify security incidents
2. **Analysis**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Limit damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve security

### Best Practices

1. Have a documented incident response plan
2. Conduct regular drills
3. Maintain contact information for key personnel
4. Document all incidents
5. Review and update procedures regularly

## Compliance and Auditing

### Compliance Standards

Eden is designed to help meet compliance requirements for:

- SOC 2
- ISO 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA (with appropriate configuration)

### Auditing

- Comprehensive audit logs
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning

### Best Practices

1. Maintain documentation of security controls
2. Conduct regular compliance reviews
3. Update security measures as requirements change
4. Train staff on compliance requirements
5. Engage third-party auditors when necessary
