# Eden DevOps Suite - Core Concepts

## What is Eden?

**Eden** is a unified DevOps and productivity platform designed to create a _perfect, pristine_ environment for developers and operations teams. It combines secrets management, infrastructure automation, task orchestration, monitoring, and workflow automation into a single, integrated suite.

## Core Philosophy

Inspired by the Garden of Eden — a symbol of purity, simplicity, and ideal conditions — Eden aims to deliver:

### 🌱 Seamless Developer Experience

## The Eden CLI Experience

### Unified Command Interface

The `eden` CLI provides a single entry point for all Eden components:

```bash
# Secrets management
eden vault set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
eden vault get DATABASE_URL

# Workflow automation
eden flow run deployment-pipeline
eden flow status pipeline-123

# Task orchestration
eden task submit build-job.yaml
eden task logs job-456

# Monitoring
eden monitor status
eden monitor create check --url https://api.example.com

# Multi-cloud sync
eden sync costs --provider aws,gcp
eden sync optimize --recommendations

# Analytics
eden insight dashboard --name "API Performance"
eden insight metrics --export csv

# Service discovery
eden hub register service --name api --port 8080
eden hub discover --service database
```

### Context-Aware Intelligence

The CLI automatically detects:
- **Project Configuration**: Reads `.eden.yml` for project-specific settings
- **User Permissions**: Respects role-based access controls
- **Environment Context**: Adapts behavior based on dev/staging/prod
- **Service Dependencies**: Understands service relationships

### Secure by Default

- **Strong Authentication**: Token-based auth with automatic refresh
- **Encrypted Communication**: All API calls use TLS
- **Local Caching**: Secure offline capabilities with encrypted cache
- **Audit Logging**: All commands logged for compliance

## User Journey Example

### Solo Developer Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install and authenticate
   eden auth login --email developer@company.com
   
   # Store project secrets
   eden vault set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/myapp"
   eden vault set API_KEY="sk-1234567890"
   ```

2. **Development Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create deployment workflow
   eden flow create deployment --template ci-cd
   
   # Run tests and deploy
   eden task submit test-suite.yaml
   eden flow run deployment --env staging
   ```

3. **Monitoring & Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Set up monitoring
   eden monitor create --url https://staging.myapp.com
   
   # Check cloud costs
   eden sync costs --this-month
   eden sync optimize --auto-apply
   ```
