# Eden Development Roadmap

## Current Status

Eden is **production-ready** with all core services implemented and fully functional. The platform provides a complete DevOps solution through a single 19MB binary.

## Completed Features

### Core Services
- **Vault Service** - Zero-knowledge secrets management with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Flow Service** - Visual workflow automation with event-driven architecture
- **Task Service** - Distributed task orchestration with Redis queuing
- **Monitor Service** - Real-time monitoring with AI-powered anomaly detection
- **Sync Service** - Multi-cloud data synchronization and cost optimization
- **Insight Service** - Privacy-first analytics with predictive intelligence
- **Hub Service** - Service discovery and integration hub
- **API Gateway** - Authentication, routing, and request management

### Infrastructure
- **Database Layer** - PostgreSQL with connection pooling and migrations
- **Event System** - Redis-based pub/sub for service communication
- **Security** - JWT authentication, RBAC, and audit logging
- **Monitoring** - Health checks, metrics collection, and alerting
- **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests

### Deployment
- **Single Binary** - All services compiled into one 19MB executable
- **Docker Support** - Multi-stage builds with health checks
- **Kubernetes** - Production-ready manifests and Helm charts
- **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions for testing, security, and deployment
