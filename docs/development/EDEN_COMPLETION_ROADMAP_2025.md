## 🔧 Development Guidelines & Best Practices

### **Testing Strategy**
Following the user's emphasis on regression testing:

#### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
1. **Write tests first** before implementing business logic
2. **Use existing patterns** from completed services (Vault, Flow, Task)
3. **Leverage shared testing infrastructure** for consistency
4. **Maintain test data builders** for reliable test data

#### **Test Categories**
```kotlin
// Test structure for each service
src/test/kotlin/com/ataiva/eden/{service}/
├── service/{Service}Test.kt           # Unit tests (business logic)
├── controller/{Service}ControllerTest.kt # API endpoint tests
├── repository/{Service}RepositoryTest.kt # Database integration tests
├── integration/{Service}IntegrationTest.kt # End-to-end tests
└── performance/{Service}PerformanceTest.kt # Load and performance tests
```

#### **Regression Prevention**
- **Automated CI/CD pipeline** with full test suite execution
- **Pre-commit hooks** for test execution and code quality
- **Performance benchmarking** to detect degradation
- **Database migration testing** to prevent schema issues

### **Implementation Standards**

#### **Service Architecture Pattern**
```kotlin
// Standard service structure
services/{service}/src/main/kotlin/com/ataiva/eden/{service}/
├── Application.kt                     # Main application entry point
├── model/{Service}Models.kt           # Data models and DTOs
├── service/{Service}Service.kt        # Core business logic
├── controller/{Service}Controller.kt  # REST API endpoints
├── repository/{Service}Repository.kt  # Data access layer
├── engine/{Service}Engine.kt          # Processing engines (if needed)
└── config/{Service}Config.kt          # Configuration management
```

#### **Database Integration**
- **Repository pattern** for data access abstraction
- **Flyway migrations** for schema versioning
- **Connection pooling** for performance
- **Transaction management** for data consistency

#### **Error Handling**
- **Consistent error response format** across all services
- **Proper HTTP status codes** for different error types
