## Current Limitations

### What Doesn't Work Yet
- **Authentication**: No working login/logout functionality
- **Secrets Management**: CLI commands return "to be implemented"
- **Service Communication**: Services don't communicate with each other
- **Web UI**: Not functional, only build configuration exists
- **Workflows**: No workflow execution capability
- **Monitoring**: No actual monitoring functionality

### Known Issues
- CLI build process requires platform-specific commands
- Docker Compose setup needs manual database initialization
- No automated testing pipeline
- Documentation references non-existent features

## Getting Involved
