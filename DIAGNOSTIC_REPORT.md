# Test Failure Diagnostic Report

## Problem Analysis Summary

### ✅ VALIDATED: Memory Exhaustion (Primary Issue)
**Evidence:**
- System has only **62MB free memory** (3996 pages × 16KB = 62MB)
- Docker compose tries to build **8 services simultaneously**
- Each build runs full Gradle build with entire project context
- Gradle daemon logs show: "cannot allocate memory" and "daemon disappeared unexpectedly"
- Docker system shows 22.8GB of images and 18.44GB build cache

**Impact:** Complete failure of Docker builds during e2e test setup

### ✅ VALIDATED: Missing Test Utility Functions (Secondary Issue)
**Evidence:**
- `generateTestKey()` function missing from CryptoTestUtils
- `createOrganization()` and `createUser()` functions missing from shared testing
- Missing JUnit imports (`@Test`, `assumeTrue`)
- Compilation errors in both performance-tests and integration-tests

**Impact:** Test compilation failures preventing test execution

## Diagnostic Logging Added

### 1. Memory Validation
- Added diagnostic comments to docker-compose.test.yml
- Enhanced Dockerfile with memory logging before/after builds
- Added --info --stacktrace flags for detailed build failure logs

### 2. Missing Functions Validation
- Added diagnostic comments to CryptoTestUtils.kt
- Added diagnostic comments to DatabaseIntegrationTest.kt
- Confirmed missing functions through file searches

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. **CRITICAL:** Fix memory exhaustion by:
   - Building services sequentially instead of parallel
   - Reducing Docker build context size
   - Adding memory limits to Docker builds

2. **HIGH:** Add missing test utility functions:
   - Add `generateTestKey()` to CryptoTestUtils
   - Add `createOrganization()` and `createUser()` helper functions
   - Fix missing JUnit imports

## System Resources
- **Available Memory:** 62MB free (critically low)
- **Docker Images:** 22.8GB (95% reclaimable)
- **Build Cache:** 18.44GB (100% reclaimable)
- **Running Containers:** 3 containers using ~510MB total

## Next Steps
Ready to implement fixes based on validated diagnosis.
