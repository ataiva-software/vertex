# Vault Service Security Guide

This document provides security guidelines and best practices for using the Eden Vault service.

## Overview

The Eden Vault service is designed to securely store and manage sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets. It uses industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and techniques to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of stored secrets.

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **Authentication**: 128-bit authentication tag
- **Nonce Size**: 96 bits (12 bytes)

AES-GCM provides both confidentiality and authenticity, ensuring that data cannot be tampered with without detection.

### Key Derivation

- **Primary Algorithm**: Argon2id
- **Fallback Algorithm**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- **Salt Size**: 16 bytes (128 bits)
- **Recommended Parameters**:
  - Memory: 64 MB (65536 KB)
  - Iterations: 3-4
  - Parallelism: 4-8 (based on available CPU cores)

Argon2id is a memory-hard function designed to be resistant to both GPU-based attacks and side-channel attacks.

### Zero-Knowledge Encryption

The Vault service implements zero-knowledge encryption, meaning that:

1. Data is encrypted on the client side before being sent to the server
2. The encryption key is derived from the user's password and never sent to the server
3. The server never has access to the plaintext data or the encryption key
4. Only the user with the correct password can decrypt the data

### Random Number Generation

- Uses Java's SecureRandom with platform-specific implementations:
  - `/dev/urandom` on Linux
  - `CryptGenRandom` on Windows
  - `SecRandomCopyBytes` on macOS

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never hardcode secrets** in your application code or configuration files
2. **Use the Vault API** to retrieve secrets at runtime
3. **Implement proper authentication** before accessing the Vault service
4. **Limit access** to only the secrets your application needs
5. **Rotate secrets regularly** to minimize the impact of potential breaches
6. **Use unique, strong passwords** for each secret
7. **Enable audit logging** to track access to sensitive secrets
8. **Implement proper error handling** to avoid leaking sensitive information

### For Administrators

1. **Implement least privilege access** for all users and services
2. **Enable multi-factor authentication** for all users
3. **Regularly audit access logs** to detect suspicious activity
4. **Implement secret rotation policies** based on sensitivity and risk
5. **Configure proper backup and recovery procedures** for the Vault database
6. **Ensure secure communication** by using TLS for all connections
7. **Implement network segmentation** to limit access to the Vault service
8. **Regularly update** the Vault service to get the latest security patches

## API Security

1. **Authentication**: All requests to the Vault API must be authenticated using JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Access to secrets is controlled by RBAC policies
3. **Rate Limiting**: API requests are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks
4. **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks
5. **Output Encoding**: All API outputs are properly encoded to prevent XSS attacks
6. **Error Handling**: Error messages do not reveal sensitive information
7. **Logging**: All API access is logged for audit purposes

## Data Protection

### At Rest

- Secrets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before being stored in the database
- Encryption keys are derived from user passwords using Argon2id
- Database backups are also encrypted

### In Transit

- All communication with the Vault service is encrypted using TLS 1.3
- Certificate pinning is used to prevent MITM attacks
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled

### In Use

- Secrets are only decrypted in memory when needed
- Memory containing secrets is zeroed out after use
- Secrets are never logged or written to disk in plaintext

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Isolate** the affected systems
2. **Investigate** the scope and impact of the breach
3. **Rotate** all potentially compromised secrets
4. **Notify** affected users and stakeholders
5. **Review** and improve security controls

## Security Audit

The Vault service undergoes regular security audits by independent security firms. The latest audit report is available in the `security/audit` directory.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Vault service, please report it by sending an email to security@ataiva.eden. Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by our team.
