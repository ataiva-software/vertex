                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

## Extending the System

### Creating Custom Connectors

The Integration Connectors system is designed to be extensible. To create a custom connector:

1. Implement the `IntegrationConnector` interface
2. Register the connector with the `ConnectorRegistry`
3. Implement the required methods:
   - `initialize`: Set up the connector
   - `testConnection`: Validate connectivity
   - `executeOperation`: Perform operations
   - `cleanup`: Release resources
   - `getSupportedOperations`: Define supported operations

Example:

```kotlin
class CustomConnector : IntegrationConnector {
    override val type = IntegrationType.CUSTOM
    
    override suspend fun initialize(integration: IntegrationInstance): ConnectorResult {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    override suspend fun testConnection(integration: IntegrationInstance): ConnectorTestResult {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    override suspend fun executeOperation(
        integration: IntegrationInstance,
        operation: String,
        parameters: Map<String, Any>
    ): ConnectorOperationResult {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    override suspend fun cleanup(integration: IntegrationInstance) {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    override fun getSupportedOperations(): List<ConnectorOperation> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

The Integration Connectors system implements several security measures:

- **Credential Encryption**: All integration credentials are encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: Operations are restricted based on user permissions
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for security auditing
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have configurable rate limits
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure default configurations for all connectors

## Performance Considerations

The system is optimized for performance:

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse of connections to external services
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking I/O for improved throughput
- **Caching**: Caching of frequently accessed data
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of resources
- **Batching**: Combining multiple operations when possible
- **Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts for all operations

## Conclusion

The Integration Connectors system in the Eden Hub Service provides a comprehensive, production-ready solution for integrating with external systems and services. It replaces all previously mocked implementations with fully functional, enterprise-grade connectors that enable seamless communication with various third-party platforms.
