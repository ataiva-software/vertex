### Component Interactions

The Eden DevOps Suite is built around several key services that interact through well-defined APIs and an event-driven architecture:

1. **API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, authorization, and routing.

2. **Hub Service**: Central coordination service that manages integrations with external systems and orchestrates workflows.

3. **Task Service**: Handles task execution, scheduling, and monitoring, with support for distributed task processing.

4. **Flow Service**: Manages workflow definitions, execution, and monitoring, with support for complex business processes.

5. **Vault Service**: Provides secure storage and management of secrets, keys, and sensitive configuration.

6. **Insight Service**: Delivers analytics, reporting, and visualization capabilities, with support for custom dashboards.

These services communicate through:
- **REST APIs**: For synchronous request-response interactions
- **Event Bus**: For asynchronous, event-driven communication using Redis as the message broker
- **Shared Databases**: For persistent storage of service-specific data

### Data Flow

Data flows through the system in a secure and controlled manner:

1. **Client Requests**: All client requests enter through the API Gateway, which authenticates and authorizes the request before routing it to the appropriate service.

2. **Service Processing**: Each service processes requests according to its domain responsibility, interacting with other services as needed through APIs or events.

3. **Data Storage**: Services store data in PostgreSQL databases, with proper schema management and migration support.

4. **Event Publication**: Services publish events to the Redis-based event bus when significant state changes occur.

5. **Event Consumption**: Services subscribe to relevant events and react accordingly, enabling loose coupling and scalability.

6. **External Integrations**: The Hub Service manages interactions with external systems, providing a unified interface for integration.
