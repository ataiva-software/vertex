## 6. Updated Timeline

Based on current progress and remaining work, the updated timeline is as follows:

- **Phase 1 Completion**: Expected by Week 6 (2 weeks behind original schedule)
- **Phase 2 Completion**: Expected by Week 10 (2 weeks behind original schedule)
- **Phase 3 Completion**: Expected by Week 14 (2 weeks behind original schedule)
- **Phase 4 Completion**: Expected by Week 18 (2 weeks behind original schedule)

Total project completion is now estimated at 18-20 weeks from the start date, which is slightly behind the original 18-24 week estimate but still within the acceptable range.

## 7. Conclusion

The Eden implementation is progressing steadily with significant achievements in core security components and service functionality. The focus on security and encryption has established a solid foundation for the remaining work. While there are some delays in the database infrastructure implementation, the overall project is still on track to be completed within the original timeframe.

The next phase of work should focus on completing the database infrastructure and security components, followed by external integrations and workflow functionality. This will ensure that the most critical components are implemented first, providing a solid foundation for the remaining work.
