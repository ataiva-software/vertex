   - Isolate affected services to prevent cascading failures
   - Redirect traffic if necessary

3. **Recovery Steps**
   - Restart affected services: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/<service-name>`
   - If restart fails, redeploy from latest artifacts:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/<service-name>.yaml
     ```
   - Verify service health endpoints

4. **Verification**
   - Confirm service is responding correctly
   - Check logs for error messages
   - Verify integration with dependent services

### Procedure 2: PostgreSQL Database Recovery

1. **Identification**
   - Confirm database failure through monitoring alerts
