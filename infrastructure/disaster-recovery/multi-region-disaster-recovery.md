## Introduction

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the Vertex DevOps Suite in a multi-region deployment. It provides detailed steps for recovering from various disaster scenarios, ensuring business continuity and minimal data loss.

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:
- Define recovery procedures for different disaster scenarios in a multi-region deployment
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities during a disaster recovery event
- Provide step-by-step instructions for recovery operations
- Ensure consistent and reliable recovery processes

### Scope

This document covers disaster recovery procedures for the Vertex DevOps Suite deployed across multiple AWS regions (us-east-1 and us-west-2). It includes:

- Database recovery (PostgreSQL with bi-directional replication)
- Cache recovery (Redis with active-active CRDT replication)
- Service recovery across regions
- Network and DNS failover procedures
- Data consistency verification and reconciliation

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The maximum acceptable length of time between disaster occurrence and service restoration:

| Priority | System Component | RTO |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Critical | API Gateway, Vault Service | 5 minutes |
| High | Hub Service, Flow Service, Task Service | 15 minutes |
| Medium | Monitor Service, Sync Service, Insight Service | 30 minutes |
| Low | Web UI, Non-production environments | 2 hours |

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time:

| Priority | System Component | RPO |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Critical | API Gateway, Vault Service | 0 minutes (zero data loss) |
| High | Hub Service, Flow Service, Task Service | 5 minutes |
| Medium | Monitor Service, Sync Service, Insight Service | 15 minutes |
| Low | Web UI, Non-production environments | 1 hour |

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Region Failure

**Description**: One region (either primary or secondary) becomes completely unavailable due to a major outage.

**Impact Level**: High

**Recovery Strategy**: Automatic failover to the healthy region using the automated failover system.

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption or Failure

**Description**: Database becomes corrupted or unavailable in one or both regions.

**Impact Level**: Critical

**Recovery Strategy**: 
- If corruption in one region: Restore from the healthy region's database
- If corruption in both regions: Restore from the latest backup

### Scenario 3: Network Partition Between Regions

**Description**: Network connectivity between regions is lost, but each region continues to operate independently.

**Impact Level**: High

**Recovery Strategy**: Split-brain detection and resolution, with one region designated as authoritative.

### Scenario 4: Data Inconsistency Between Regions

**Description**: Data becomes inconsistent between regions due to replication failures or conflicts.

**Impact Level**: Medium to High

**Recovery Strategy**: Data reconciliation and consistency verification procedures.

### Scenario 5: Complete Multi-Region Outage

**Description**: Both primary and secondary regions become unavailable simultaneously.

**Impact Level**: Critical

**Recovery Strategy**: Recovery from backups to a third region or recovery of at least one existing region.

## Recovery Procedures

### Procedure 1: Automated Regional Failover

This procedure is automatically executed by the automated failover system when a region failure is detected. Manual execution may be required if the automated system fails.

#### Prerequisites
- Access to AWS Management Console
- Access to Kubernetes clusters in both regions
- Access to DNS management console

#### Steps

1. **Verify Region Failure**
   ```bash
   # Check primary region health
   kubectl --context eks-us-east-1 get nodes
   kubectl --context eks-us-east-1 -n vertex get pods
   
   # Check secondary region health
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 get nodes
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 -n vertex get pods
   ```

2. **Update DNS for Global Load Balancing**
   ```bash
   # Update Route 53 to direct 100% traffic to healthy region
   ./infrastructure/network/scripts/update-route53-weights.sh us-west-2 100 us-east-1 0
   ```

3. **Update Global Accelerator**
   ```bash
   # Update Global Accelerator endpoint weights
   ./infrastructure/network/scripts/update-global-accelerator-weights.sh us-west-2 100 us-east-1 0
   ```

4. **Promote Database in Healthy Region**
   ```bash
   # For PostgreSQL
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 -n vertex exec -it deploy/postgres-operator -- patronictl switchover --force
   
   # For Redis
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 -n vertex exec -it statefulset/redis-sentinel -c sentinel -- redis-cli -p 26379 sentinel failover vertex-master
   ```

5. **Scale Up Services in Healthy Region**
   ```bash
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 -n vertex scale deployment --replicas=3 --all
   ```

6. **Verify Service Health**
   ```bash
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 -n vertex get pods
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 -n vertex get endpoints
   ```

7. **Notify Stakeholders**
   ```bash
   # Send notification via Slack and email
   ./infrastructure/scripts/send-notification.sh "Regional failover completed. Services are now running in us-west-2."
   ```

### Procedure 2: Database Recovery from Corruption

#### Prerequisites
- Access to Kubernetes clusters in both regions
- Access to database backups
- Database administrator crvertextials

#### Steps

1. **Identify Corruption Scope**

   # Check table consistency
   kubectl --context eks-us-east-1 -n vertex exec -it deploy/postgres -c postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database;"
   ```

2. **Isolate Corrupted Database**
   ```bash
   # Stop applications from accessing the corrupted database
   kubectl --context eks-us-east-1 -n vertex scale deployment --replicas=0 --all
   ```

3. **Assess Replication Status**
   ```bash
   # Check if corruption has replicated to secondary region
   kubectl --context eks-us-west-2 -n vertex exec -it deploy/postgres -c postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
   ```

4. **Recovery Options**

   a. **If secondary region is healthy:**
   ```bash
   # Restore from secondary region
   ./infrastructure/database/scripts/postgres-restore-from-region.sh us-west-2 us-east-1
   ```

   b. **If both regions are corrupted:**
   ```bash
   # Restore from latest backup
   ./infrastructure/backup/scripts/postgres_restore.sh --db=all --target-region=us-east-1
   ./infrastructure/backup/scripts/postgres_restore.sh --db=all --target-region=us-west-2
   ```

5. **Verify Data Integrity**
   ```bash
